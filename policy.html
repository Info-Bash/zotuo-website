Zotou employees, contractors, service providers, affiliates, and other persons or entities (collectively, “Representatives”) responsible for contacting customers and prospective customers by telephone are required to comply with the policies and procedures set forth herein as well as all applicable laws and regulations.</p>

      <h2>Zotou Corporate Do-Not-Call List</h2>
      <p>Zotou maintains an internal DNC List (the “Zotuo DNC List”) to help ensure that it and its Representatives do not call consumers who do not wish to be contacted by Zotou. Any and all consumers who request to be added to the Zotou DNC List are added to the list at or about the time the request is made, and in no event more than 30 days from the date of the request.</p>

      <p>Zotou's Representatives are required to notify Zotou about any consumer who has requested to not be contacted regarding Zotou's products and services so that they may be added to the Zotou DNC List.<br>
      Zotou and any Representatives that call on its behalf access and scrub against the Zotou DNC List prior to making any outbound calls to consumers.
